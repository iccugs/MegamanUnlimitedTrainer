# MegamanUnlimitedTrainer

Trainer for Megaman Unlimited version 1.3.1

## Credits

This project was built using tutorials and code examples from [**GuidedHacking.com**](https://guidedhacking.com). All credit for the original memory manipulation, process injection, and core trainer functionality goes to the GuidedHacking community and their educational resources. This project simply builds upon their foundational work and adapts it for the Castlevania Dominus Collection.

Special thanks to [GuidedHacking.com](https://guidedhacking.com) for their comprehensive game hacking tutorials and code examples.

### Learn to Make Game Hacks

I learned everything I needed to know about pointer scanning and hacking Unity games by using the website [GuidedHacking.com](https://guidedhacking.com). If you're interested in creating fun and easy game hacks like this, I highly recommend signing up for their website and exploring their tutorials.

## Includes

- Cheat Engine Table (CT file)
- Source code for C++ trainer
- Executable for C++ trainer in the Debug folder

## Notes

- You can only survive one-hit-kill rainbow attacks by setting the health value higher than max. The C++ trainer does this by default (automatically sets it to 99 health bars).
- Z-Prototype can use Megaman's Beat and shock boots if you set their values higher than zero. The C++ trainer does this by default (automatically sets both to 9).
